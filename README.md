# PredictiveModel
DSA211 Statistical Learning with R Group Project.
Dataset Central2024P.csv records the information of 2500 private property resale transactions in the Central District of Singapore during 2023 (from REALIS database).
We are required to construct a predictive model to predict the price of private property, Price, with five independent variables: Area, Age, Tenure, Purchaser and Region.
Price: Condominium transaction price in dollars
Area: Size of the condominium unit in square feet
Age: Age of condominium unit
Tenure: Freehold or Leasehold
Purchaser: HDB or Private
Region: 15 different regions in the Central District.

Dataset Central2024testP.csv consists of remaining test data. We are required to apply our predictive model on this test data set and determine the mean squared error.
